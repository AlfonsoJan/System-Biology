# System Biology Theme 8

For this course we are introduced to modelling biological systems using computer simulations. We will learn about the relations between reality, experiments and models, how to describe biological systems as mathematical models that can be simulated, and how to interpret the results. 

For the main assignment, we will search a scientific literature for a systems biology study on a topic of your interest and repeat the study in R.

The following topics will be dealt with:
> * Modelling and simulation.
> * Differential equations.
> * Dynamics, convergence and equilibrium.
> * Setting up and running simulations using R.
> * Searching, reading (and writing) scientific articles.
